4d world array - got basics down still need optimizations
chunking
entity types
    terrain - floor, walls, furniture, ?doors,

    effects - lighting? maybe we will do lighting like this maybe not

add entities class to game.py (done)
still need to do :
    -movement without breaking render (likely something todo for renderer class not entities class)

--fix player class (player class is gone! not applicable)--
    ----movement--
